\title{Simulate burnout risk over time}
\usage{
simulate_burnout(n_tasks, p, threshold = 3, days = 30, reps = 1000, seed = 123)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_tasks}{Integer. Initial number of pending tasks.}

\item{p}{Numeric. Probability of completing a task on a given day (0 to 1).}

\item{threshold}{Integer. Burnout is likely if pending tasks exceed this number.}

\item{days}{Integer. Number of days to simulate.}

\item{reps}{Integer. Number of simulation repetitions to average over.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 123.}
}
\value{
A data frame with daily average burnout risk and average pending tasks.
}
\description{
This function estimates burnout risk through Monte Carlo simulation,
assuming a given task load, daily productivity, and burnout threshold.
