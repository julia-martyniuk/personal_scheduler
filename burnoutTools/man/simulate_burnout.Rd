\title{Simulate burnout risk over time with dynamic workload}
\usage{
simulate_burnout(
  n_tasks,
  p,
  threshold = 3,
  days = 30,
  reps = 1000,
  task_arrival_rate = 0.5,
  seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_tasks}{Integer. Number of pending tasks at Day 0.}

\item{p}{Numeric. Initial daily productivity (as a probability between 0 and 1).}

\item{threshold}{Integer. Burnout threshold â€” risk increases if pending tasks exceed this value.}

\item{days}{Integer. Number of simulation days.}

\item{reps}{Integer. Number of repetitions for averaging.}

\item{task_arrival_rate}{Numeric. Average number of new tasks arriving per day (Poisson-distributed).}

\item{seed}{Integer. Optional random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{Day}{Simulation day (1, 2, ..., days)}
\item{BurnoutRisk}{Average estimated burnout risk per day}
\item{AvgPendingTasks}{Average pending task count per day}
\item{Fatigue}{Average daily productivity loss}
\item{Summary_HighRiskDays}{Average number of days with burnout risk > 0.7}
\item{Summary_PeakRiskDay}{Day when burnout risk peaked}
\item{Summary_MaxFatigue}{Maximum observed fatigue across the simulation}
}
}
\description{
This function performs a Monte Carlo simulation of task backlog and burnout risk over time.
It models daily task arrivals, task completions based on productivity, and feedback effects
such as fatigue (which lowers productivity) and recovery (which restores it gradually).
